Hi, and welcome to [dev.jamovi.org](https://dev.jamovi.org), the developer hub for [jamovi](https://www.jamovi.org).

Here you will find resources that cover the development of analyses for jamovi (and R). It's still a work in progress, and we'll be adding to it over time, but the current tutorial series has everything you need to get up and running.

There are forums available at [forum.jamovi.org](https://forum.jamovi.org), so if you have questions about developing modules for jamovi, or feedback on how we can improve the developer hub, we're keen to hear from you there.

contact \<at\> jamovi.org

For those interested in the jamovi platform, it is hosted on GitHub [here](https://github.com/jamovi/jamovi). Don't forget to 'star' us!
